## Fine-tuning Experiments
Navigate to the task fodler and check run.sh for sample command. 

Modify the file path for configuration file, model checkpoint and vocabulary.

## Checkpoints
The pre-trained models can be found here: [GigaBERT-v3](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zgUXz8FQPHmWVNR7tHyPq1E6SmrMuPv6?usp=sharing) and [GigaBERT-v4](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uFGzMuTOD7iNsmKQYp_zVuvsJwOaIdar?usp=sharing) 

Please contact [Wuwei Lan](lan.105@osu.edu) for the original TF checkpoints or different code-switched pre-trained models.
